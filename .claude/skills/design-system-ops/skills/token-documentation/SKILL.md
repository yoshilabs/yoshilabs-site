# Token documentation

A skill for writing documentation for design tokens that communicates semantic intent, usage context, and application rules across all three tiers. Output is reference documentation that tells consumers what a token means and how to use it correctly — not just what value it resolves to.

## Context

Token documentation has a chronic problem: it stops at the value. A token reference that says `color.action.primary: #0066CC` tells a consumer the resolved colour, but not when to use it, what it communicates to users, which components it belongs on, or what happens when it is misapplied. Teams that rely purely on value-level documentation make naming decisions based on colour proximity rather than semantic intent, and the system drifts.

The goal is documentation that makes the semantic contract legible. A consumer reading these docs should come away understanding not just what a token resolves to, but why it exists and where it belongs.

## Boundaries

This skill documents existing tokens. It does not create new tokens, redesign the token architecture, or validate token file structure (use `schema-validator` for structural validation, `token-audit` for architectural assessment). If the token set is empty or has not been defined yet, this skill does not apply — help the team establish their token architecture first. If only primitive tokens exist (no semantic tier), note that the documentation value is limited since primitive tokens are largely self-documenting, and suggest establishing a semantic tier before investing in documentation.

## Configuration

Before producing output, check for a `.ds-ops-config.yml` file in the project root. If present, load:
- `integrations.style_dictionary` — if enabled, parse the token tree automatically
- `integrations.figma` — if enabled, pull Figma variables to cross-reference
- `integrations.documentation` — if enabled, check for existing token docs to update rather than rewrite

## Auto-pull integrations

**Style Dictionary v4** (`integrations.style_dictionary.enabled: true`):
- Parse the config to extract the complete token tree with resolved references
- Auto-detect tier structure, token names, values, and reference chains
- This replaces the manual "provide your token files" step

**Figma MCP** (`integrations.figma.enabled: true`):
- Pull Figma variable collections and modes (light/dark, brand variants)
- Cross-reference Figma variables against code tokens for completeness check

**Documentation platform** (`integrations.documentation.enabled: true`):
- Check for existing token documentation to incorporate rather than overwrite

If an integration fails, log it and proceed with manual input.

## Step 1: Gather the token set

Ask for or confirm (skip questions already answered by auto-pull):
- The tokens to be documented (a specific set, a full tier, or the entire system)
- The source format: JSON, DTCG, Tokens Studio export, Style Dictionary configuration, CSS custom properties (`:root { --token: value; }`), SCSS/Sass variables (`$token: value;`), TypeScript/JavaScript token objects, Tailwind config (`theme` / `extend` block), or listed by name
- Any existing documentation or notes on intent that should be incorporated
- The audience for the documentation (designers only, developers only, or both — this affects the technical depth)

For CSS custom properties and SCSS variables: infer token hierarchy from naming patterns (e.g. `--color-blue-500` → primitive, `--color-action-primary` → semantic, `--button-bg-default` → component). For Tailwind configs, the `theme` block is the token source. For TypeScript/JavaScript token objects: the exported object hierarchy maps directly to token tiers — nested keys are the path (e.g. `tokens.color.brand.blue[500]` → `color.brand.blue.500`). Include both the object key path and resolved value in the documentation. For `as const` objects, the literal types provide exact values without runtime ambiguity.

If the full system is being documented, suggest starting with the semantic tier. Primitive tokens document themselves — their names and values are sufficient. Semantic tokens are where intent documentation does the most work. If the system uses component tokens, include those after semantics.

## Step 2: Document by tier

### Primitive tokens

Primitive token documentation is lightweight. The goal is to establish what the scale looks like and what it is derived from — not to explain when to use `color.blue.400` vs `color.blue.500`, because that is the semantic tier's job.

Document:
- Scale overview: how the scale is structured and what increments mean
- Source: where the values come from (a specific palette tool, a brand colour system, a typographic scale)
- Usage constraint: one sentence stating that primitive tokens should not be used directly in components — they are referenced by semantic tokens

Format per primitive group:
```
[Token group name]
Scale: [describe the scale — e.g. 50–950 in 50-point increments, or T-shirt sizing]
Source: [where values come from]
Values: [list or reference to the token file]
Usage: Reference via semantic tokens only.
```

### Semantic tokens

Semantic tokens carry the intent contract. This is where most documentation effort belongs.

For each semantic token or semantic token group, document:

**Intent:** What does this token communicate to users? One sentence. Not what it looks like — what it means.
Example: `color.action.primary` — Identifies the primary interactive action in a given context. Signals that an element is the most important or most expected next step for the user.

**Resolved value:** What value does this token produce in the default theme? (And in other themes if theming is supported.)

**Tier reference:** Which primitive token does this semantic token reference?

**Usage context:** Where this token belongs — which component surfaces, which states, which user-facing roles.

**Usage constraint:** Where this token should not be used — specific misuse patterns to avoid.

**Component associations:** Which components from the design system use this token by default.

Format per semantic token:
```
[token.name]

Intent: [one sentence on what this token communicates]
Resolved value: [value(s) by theme]
References: [primitive token(s)]

Use on: [list of appropriate surfaces or component types]
Do not use on: [specific misuse contexts]

Used by: [component names that reference this token by default]
```

### Component tokens (include only if the system uses them)

Not every system has a component token tier — many systems bind semantic tokens directly in component code, and that is a valid architecture. If the system does use component tokens, they are the most specific tier and the most commonly under-documented because they feel obvious. "Of course `button.background.default` is the button's default background" — but what should happen if a product team wants to override it? Which semantic token should they route through? Are there states the documentation has not covered?

If the system does not use component tokens, skip this section entirely. Do not recommend introducing them unless the context calls for it (white-labelling, multi-brand, complex components with many token bindings).

For component tokens, document:
- Which component this token belongs to
- Which prop or state it controls
- Which semantic token it references (and why — if the mapping is not obvious)
- Whether overriding this token at the product level is expected or discouraged

Group component token documentation by component. Do not produce a flat alphabetical list of component tokens — it is unusable.

Format per component group:
```
[Component name] tokens

[token.name] — [prop or state it controls]
References: [semantic token]
Override guidance: [expected / discouraged / never — with one-sentence reason]
```

## Step 3: Document the theming contract (if applicable)

If the system supports multiple themes (light/dark, brand variants, platform-specific themes), document how the semantic tokens resolve across themes and what the contract is for adding a new theme.

This documentation is often missing entirely, which means teams learn the theming system by reading the token files rather than by reading a clear contract. The contract should answer:
- Which tokens change across themes and which stay fixed
- How a new theme is added and what tokens are required
- What happens if a token is not defined in a custom theme (fallback behaviour)

## Step 4: Add the misuse reference

At the end of the documentation, include a brief misuse reference: a list of the most common incorrect token usages the design systems team has seen, with the correct alternative for each.

Format:
```
Common misuse: Using [wrong token] to achieve [visual outcome]
Why it's wrong: [one sentence — what the wrong token communicates that conflicts with the intended use]
Use instead: [correct token]
```

Five to ten entries is usually enough to cover the most frequent errors.

## Step 4b: Token governance note

At the top of the token documentation, include a governance section that answers the question every consumer eventually asks: "Who do I talk to when I need a token that does not exist?"

**Token governance:**
- **Token owner:** [Named person or team responsible for the token architecture]
- **Request process:** [How to request a new token — contribution workflow reference, Slack channel, or issue template]
- **Change cadence:** [How often are token changes released? Is there a review cycle?]
- **Documentation updates:** When a token changes, the documentation is updated by [owner / contributor / automated from token source]. If documentation lags behind token changes, report it to [channel].

This note prevents the common failure mode where token documentation is accurate at publication but becomes stale because no one owns the update process.

## Step 5: DTCG 2025.10 alignment documentation (staff-level)

If the system uses or is migrating to DTCG 2025.10 format, include a specification alignment section:

**Token type documentation.** For each DTCG token type used in the system, document:
- The type name (e.g., `color`, `dimension`, `typography`, `shadow`)
- How the system uses it (which tokens carry this type)
- For composite types: the sub-value structure and which sub-values are required vs optional

**Resolver and set documentation.** If the system uses DTCG resolvers:
- Document each token set: its purpose, which tokens it contains, and which files it references
- Document each mode: its name, purpose, and which sets it activates
- Document the composition order: when multiple sets are active, which takes precedence?
- Include a visual map of sets and modes if the resolver is complex (3+ sets or modes)

**Migration status.** For systems partially migrated to DTCG:
- Which token categories are DTCG-compliant and which are not?
- What are the known gaps (missing `$type` annotations, non-standard composite structures)?
- What is the migration path for each gap?

## Step 5b: Machine-readable token reference (staff-level)

Produce a supplementary JSON reference that AI tools and build pipelines can consume directly:

```json
{
  "tokenArchitecture": {
    "tiers": ["primitive", "semantic", "component"],
    "format": "dtcg-2025.10|style-dictionary|custom",
    "totalTokenCount": 0,
    "themeSupport": true|false,
    "themes": ["light", "dark"]
  },
  "semanticTokens": [
    {
      "name": "color.action.primary",
      "type": "color",
      "intent": "Primary interactive action colour",
      "references": "color.blue.500",
      "themes": {
        "light": "#0066CC",
        "dark": "#66AAFF"
      },
      "usedBy": ["button.background.default", "link.color.default"],
      "useOn": ["primary actions", "interactive elements"],
      "doNotUseOn": ["decorative surfaces", "text body"]
    }
  ]
}
```

This reference complements the human-readable documentation. Keep both in sync — changes to the documentation should be reflected in the JSON, and vice versa.

## Step 6: Format for the documentation platform

Token documentation needs to be findable, not just accurate. Recommend the following structure for the documentation platform:

- Index page: overview of the token architecture with tier explanations and links to each tier's reference
- Primitive reference: grouped by category (colour, spacing, typography, etc.)
- Semantic reference: grouped by function (actions, feedback states, text roles, surfaces, etc.)
- Component token reference: grouped by component, linked from each component's documentation page

The semantic reference is the most-used section. Make sure it is the easiest to find and navigate.

## Step 6b: Quick reference by semantic function

In addition to the full documentation, produce a one-page quick reference organised by what the consumer is trying to do, not by token category:

**"I need a colour for..."**
- Primary action (buttons, links): `color.action.primary`
- Secondary action: `color.action.secondary`
- Destructive action: `color.action.destructive`
- Success feedback: `color.feedback.success`
- Error feedback: `color.feedback.error`
- Warning feedback: `color.feedback.warning`
- Body text: `color.content.primary`
- Secondary text: `color.content.secondary`
- Surface background: `color.surface.primary`
- Elevated surface: `color.surface.elevated`

**"I need spacing for..."**
- Between related elements: `spacing.xs` or `spacing.sm`
- Between sections: `spacing.lg` or `spacing.xl`
- Page margin: `spacing.page`
- Component internal padding: `spacing.component.padding`

**"I need typography for..."**
- Page heading: `typography.heading.lg`
- Section heading: `typography.heading.md`
- Body text: `typography.body.md`
- Caption or label: `typography.body.sm`

Adapt this template to the actual tokens in the system. The quick reference should use the real token names and be published alongside the full documentation as a fast-lookup tool.

## Quality checks

- Every semantic token has an intent description, not just a value and name
- Usage context and usage constraint are both present — not just "use this for buttons"
- Component tokens reference their semantic parent and include override guidance
- The theming contract is documented if theming is supported
- The misuse reference exists and is specific
- Format is appropriate for the documentation platform — navigable, not just comprehensive
