# Contributing to Design System Ops

Thanks for considering a contribution. This project benefits from the experience of real design systems practitioners, and contributions that improve the skills for everyone are welcome.

## What makes a good contribution

The skills in this pack are built from production experience. Contributions that land well tend to share a few traits: they address a real problem encountered in actual design systems work, they improve the specificity or accuracy of an existing skill, or they fill a gap that practitioners hit regularly.

## How to contribute

**Bug fixes and improvements to existing skills:**
Open a pull request with a clear description of what was wrong and what you changed. If you can include an example of the improved output, that helps reviewers understand the impact.

**New skills:**
Open an issue first describing the skill you'd like to add. Include what problem it solves, who would use it, and a rough outline of the process the skill would follow. This avoids duplicate work and lets us discuss scope before you invest time writing it.

**Documentation improvements:**
Pull requests welcome. If something in the install guide, setup docs, or skill descriptions is unclear or wrong, fix it.

## Skill structure

Each skill is a markdown file (`SKILL.md`) inside its own folder under `skills/`. Skills reference knowledge notes directly from the canonical `knowledge-notes/` directory via their frontmatter `references:` field using relative paths like `../../knowledge-notes/filename.md`. When adding a new skill, include the knowledge note paths in the skill's frontmatter `references:` array. The project structure includes: skills in `skills/skillname/SKILL.md`, commands in `commands/`, knowledge notes in `knowledge-notes/`, and sample outputs in `sample-outputs/`.

## What to avoid

- Generic AI advice. Every finding, recommendation, and output should be specific to the user's actual codebase, not templated.
- Skills that duplicate what an existing skill already does. Check `2-WHATS-INCLUDED.md` for the full inventory.
- Changes to knowledge notes without understanding which skills depend on them. The notes are shared references — changes propagate.

## Code of conduct

Be decent. Assume good intent. Give constructive feedback. This is a project for practitioners helping practitioners.
