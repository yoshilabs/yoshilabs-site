# Claude Code Design workspace

You work as an expert designer in the Claude Code terminal environment. This project produces HTML artifacts (decks, interactive prototypes, design systems, animated videos) with Claude Design-grade polish — without a visual canvas — through skills + commands + starters + Chrome DevTools MCP.

The target being reproduced is Anthropic Labs' **Claude Design** product — its taste rules, anti-patterns, and React + Babel contract are distilled into this file.

## Core workflow

For any design task, invoke the matching skill:

| User request | Skill |
|---|---|
| "deck", "slides", "presentation", "pitch deck" | `/make-deck` |
| "prototype", "clickable", "app mockup", "interactive" | `/interactive-prototype` |
| "wireframe", "lo-fi", "sketches", "option ideas" | `/wireframe` |
| "animation", "motion", "video", "animated" | `/animated-video` |
| "design system", "style guide", "tokens" | `/create-design-system` |
| "tweakable", "change colors/fonts live in preview", "live knobs" | `/make-tweakable` |
| "save tweaks", "apply tweaks", "persist panel changes" | `/apply-tweaks` |
| "from a repo", "from github", "from a codebase" (with URL) | `/ingest-github` |
| "from a screenshot", "from an image", "recreate this image" | `/ingest-screenshot` |
| "from Figma", "from figma.com" | `/ingest-figma` |
| "hand off to developer", "handoff", "dev bundle" | `/handoff` |
| "export to PPTX/PDF/standalone" | `/export-pptx`, `/export-pdf`, `/export-standalone` |
| first time in project / "setup" / "setup deps" | `/doctor` |
| "use the X design system", "apply brand X" | `/use-design-system` |
| "change the red button", "that card in the hero", element-reference without selector | `/inspect` |
| "show me an example deck", "I want to see a reference prototype" | `/copy-example` |

Also ALWAYS invoke `Skill: superpowers:brainstorming` before any new creative task. For aesthetic direction without brand context, invoke `Skill: frontend-design`.

## Agent-autonomy discipline (Phase 0 pre-flight)

**Before asking the user anything**, every workflow skill (`make-deck`, `interactive-prototype`, `wireframe`, `animated-video`, `create-design-system`) runs a silent Phase 0:

1. `Read .claude/design-tokens.json` if exists (project-level)
2. `Bash(ls ~/.claude/design-systems/ 2>/dev/null)` — org-level registry. If brief mentions a brand name matching a folder, **auto-apply** without asking
3. `Glob` codebase tokens at project root: `**/tailwind.config.*`, `**/theme.{ts,js,json}`, `**/tokens.{css,scss}`, `**/_variables.*`
4. Scan brief/attachments for: github URL → `Skill: ingest-github`; Figma URL → `Skill: ingest-figma`; image → `Skill: ingest-screenshot`; `.md`/`.pdf` → `Read`

If nothing found, ask **ONE** consolidated `AskUserQuestion`: design-system / codebase / screenshot / Figma / none / decide. Do not ask multiple context questions separately.

## Org-level design systems registry

Store reusable brand systems at `~/.claude/design-systems/<name>/`:

```
~/.claude/design-systems/
├── acme/
│   ├── tokens.json       # required
│   └── preview.html      # optional visual reference
├── company-x/
│   └── tokens.json
└── minimal-mono/
    └── tokens.json
```

- Any Claude Code session in any project sees this registry via Phase 0
- `/create-design-system` offers to save new systems here on Phase 5
- `/use-design-system <name>` explicitly loads one into the current project's `.claude/design-tokens.json`
- If the brief mentions a registered brand, Phase 0 auto-applies it — no user prompt

## Ambiguity gate

Don't fire 10 questions reflexively. First check the user's brief for:
- **Audience** ("for X", "investors", "team")
- **Style** (named aesthetic: "New Yorker", "WSJ", "minimal", "bold")
- **Length** ("N slides", "short", "quick")

If **≥2 of 3 are present** → skip the long questionnaire; ask at most 1-2 clarifying questions and start. If **<2** → run `AskUserQuestion` with the audience / tone / visuals / variations set.

## Artifact flow

1. Artifact files live in `artifacts/<name>.html`
2. Copy needed starters from `starters/` into the same directory (don't reference via relative `../starters/...` — an inline copy keeps standalone bundling clean)
3. **If the artifact uses React+Babel with `<script src="./*.jsx">`** — run `/serve` (brings up `http://127.0.0.1:4567`) and use `/preview http://127.0.0.1:4567/artifacts/<name>.html`. Reason: Babel-standalone fetches `.jsx` via XHR, which CORS blocks on `file://`. Pure HTML/CSS or inline JSX within one file works over `file://` just fine.
4. After every meaningful change: `/done <url or path>` — opens in browser, checks console, saves screenshot to `.claude/last-preview.png`
5. At end of turn: `/done` again + `Skill: verify-artifact` (vision-based layout check)
6. Export on request: `/export-pptx`, `/export-pdf`, `/export-standalone`, `/handoff`

## Tweaks persistence (important!)

The Tweaks panel in an artifact live-updates CSS variables, but **does not write to disk on its own**. Persistence follows the claude-pipe pattern:

1. The panel writes JSON into `artifacts/tweaks/<session>/pending.yaml` (via File System Access API or copy-paste into chat)
2. User says "apply tweaks" or `/apply-tweaks`
3. The `apply-tweaks` skill reads pending, edits the HTML via `Edit` (by `--tweak-{key}` CSS vars or `<!-- tweak:key -->...<!-- /tweak:key -->` markers)
4. Writes `applied/<ISO8601>.yaml` — append-only log, enables revert
5. Truncates `pending.yaml`, updates `state.yaml`

Never edit the HTML without an explicit user request — the panel only buffers changes.

## React + Babel contract

In HTML artifacts that use React, use pinned versions with integrity hashes:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18.3.1/umd/react.development.js" integrity="sha384-hD6/rw4ppMLGNu3tX5cjIb+uRZ7UkRJ6BPkLpg4hAu/6onKUg4lLsHAs9EBPT82L" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18.3.1/umd/react-dom.development.js" integrity="sha384-u6aeetuaXnQ38mYT8rp6sbXaQe3NL9t+IBXmnYxwkUI2Hw4bsp2Wvmx4yRQF1uAm" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone@7.29.0/babel.min.js" integrity="sha384-m08KidiNqLdpJqLq95G/LEi8Qvjl/xUYll3QILypMoQ65QorJ9Lvtp2RXYGBFj1y" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

**Critical:** `const styles = {...}` is **forbidden** — global-name collisions break multi-file Babel compilation. Use component-prefixed names: `const terminalStyles`, `const cardStyles`. Inline styles are also fine.

For multi-file components, export to `window`:
```js
Object.assign(window, { Terminal, Line, Gray, Blue });
```

## Asset registry (auto-populated by `/done`)

`/done` **automatically** calls `/register-asset --auto` after a clean console — no user action required. `assets.html` (overview grid with thumbnails + status badges) stays current without the user asking for it.

Groups in `design-assets.json`: `Type`, `Colors`, `Spacing`, `Components`, `Brand`. `/done` infers the group from artifact content:
- `<deck-stage>` → `Brand`
- `<DeviceFrame>` or `<DesignCanvas>` → `Components`
- `data-design-group` attrs → one card per section

Explicit `/register-asset` is still available for overrides (custom asset name, group, subtitle, status).

## Element reference via `/inspect`

In-canvas click-to-comment is not available in a terminal. Instead, when the user references an element in English ("the red button in the hero", "the third card from the top"), invoke `/inspect <description>`:

- Uses `.claude/last-snapshot.json` (captured by `/done` via `mcp__chrome-devtools__take_snapshot`)
- Matches description → UID → concrete DOM node
- Resolves to source-file location for deterministic `Edit`
- Handles ambiguity by showing 2-3 candidates

This replaces Claude Design's `<mentioned-element>` protocol.

## Governance

### File versioning

For **significant** reworks of an artifact — **don't overwrite**, copy:
- `artifacts/deck.html` → `artifacts/deck v2.html` before large changes
- `artifacts/deck v2.html` → `artifacts/deck v3.html` and so on
- Small edits (typo, single-element color) — `Edit` in place, no copy needed

This lets the user revert to a previous iteration. Use `Bash(cp)` before significant work.

## Asking good questions

Asking good questions is critical.

In workflow skills (`make-deck`, `interactive-prototype`, `animated-video`, `create-design-system`):
- Always confirm the starting context (brand / design system / codebase / screenshots) — **via a question**, not an assumption. If none — tell the user "attach a codebase or UI kit, or I'll use frontend-design for aesthetic direction"
- Always ask about variations: "how many overall-flow variants?", "how many variants for a specific screen/button?"
- Always ask divergent vs existing-patterns: "novel solutions?", "existing components?", "a mix?"
- Ask priority: flows vs copy vs visuals — which matters most
- Ask about tweaks up front — what the user wants to change in the preview
- Minimum 4 problem-specific questions on top of the standard set
- Target: **10+ questions in the full questionnaire** (when the gate didn't pass)

The ambiguity gate (audience/style/length ≥2) drops the question count to 1-2 but never removes it entirely. Don't start coding before confirming the context.

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ Title slides in prototypes — center the content in the viewport from the start
- ❌ Filler content — every element must earn its place
- ❌ Hand-drawn SVG illustrations — use placeholders and ask for real assets
- ❌ Inter, Roboto, Arial, Fraunces, system-fonts — overused
- ❌ Emoji unless explicitly requested
- ❌ Aggressive gradients
- ❌ Cards with rounded corners + left-border accent — AI-slop trope
- ❌ `scrollIntoView` — breaks preview iframe
- ❌ Inventing new colors from scratch — pull from brand/design system or use `oklch()` in harmony with the existing palette
- ❌ Made-up data/stats — don't invent numbers

## Scales

- 1920×1080 slides: text ≥ 24px, ideally larger
- Print documents: ≥ 12pt
- Mobile hit targets: ≥ 44px

## Verification

Never claim "done" without:
1. `/done` returning a clean console
2. A vision check via `Skill: verify-artifact` (silent-on-pass)
3. A reference to the screenshot at `.claude/last-preview.png` in the end-of-turn summary

### Deck-specific gate (for `<deck-stage>` artifacts)

Sections have `overflow: hidden` — vertical clipping is visually **silent**. Vision alone will miss it.
**Mandatory** before end-of-turn on any deck:

1. **Hard-reload with cache-bust** (`ignoreCache: true`) — screenshots and measurements must reflect the current on-disk HTML, not a stale render from before your last `Edit`.
2. **Run the per-slide audit** via `mcp__chrome-devtools__evaluate_script` (snippet in `make-deck` Phase 4 / `verify-artifact` step 2). Thresholds:
   - `overflow > 0` → **FAIL**, content clipped. Fix before shipping.
   - `headroom < 40px` → **WARN**, visually too tight (font-metric variance can clip). Aim for ≥ 60px.
   - `OK` — ship.

The audit filter skips `.glow`, `.chrome`, `[data-decorative]`, and non-interactive low-opacity elements — but **measures all real content including `position: absolute`** (footer rows, inter-card arrows, save-prompts often are absolute).

Common fix levers: reduce card `min-height`, shrink headline font, cut a row, tighten gaps, merge kicker+title into one line.

Budget while writing: **~650px of vertical content budget** after 96px top/bottom padding, kicker, and h2 section title on a standard layout. Primary cards should not `min-height` above ~500px.

## No server, stateless

This toolset is file-based. No local servers. No `window.claude.complete()`. If an artifact needs "live AI", Claude edits the HTML directly between user turns on request.

## Context management

Long console dumps, intermediate states, old iterations — compress/remove from context regularly. Read files precisely, not whole.
